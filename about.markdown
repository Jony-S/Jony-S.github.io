    As you already realized, my name is Jony.

* Myself

    I recently found an interest in programming and decided to make this interest a reality, not just in the scope of my own mind. With close to no earlier experience, here I am, learning computer science in order to learn programming.

    Now you hopefully learned some new Finnish words :)
